# Email Troubleshooting

There are many potential roadblocks to successfully delivering an email to your inbox from Skorie.  Your email provider may block it, your internet provider may block it, your spam filter may block it and your email applicaiton may put it in the spam folder.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot the problem.

## 1. Send yourself an email

Login and go to your profile page and click on "Send myself a test email".  If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder.
If the email doesn't arrive after 2 minutes it has probably been blocked somewhere, although emails can turn up hours late.

## 2. Whitelist our domain in your email client

Only necessary if you are receiving frequent emails from us and usually this just avoid checking the Junk folder.
